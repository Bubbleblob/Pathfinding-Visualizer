# Pathfinding-Visualizer

## A fully functional project written in Python that visualizes pathfindining algorithms in Pygame.

This pathfinding visualizer features an array of powerful algorithms including A* search, Dijkstra's algorithm, and breadth-first search. A* search balances the use of heuristics and actual cost to determine the most optimal path between nodes in a graph. Dijkstra's algorithm uses a greedy approach by assigning tentative distances to all nodes, then iteratively selects the node with the smallest tentative distance until the end node is found. Breadth-first search explores all neighboring nodes of the start node, then continues to explore those neighbor's nodes and so on until the end node is found. The seamless integration of these algorithms with Pygame's dynamic graphical interface provides users with an immersive experience, allowing them to witness the efficiency and nuances of each method in action.
